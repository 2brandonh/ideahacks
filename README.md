# IdeaHacks IOT Whiteboard

Our project for the UCLA IdeaHacks 2020 Hackathon features an IoT Whiteboard. At UCLA, each room has a whiteboard outside for students to express themselves and put up notices. Now what if you could customize that further with lights, messages, and drawings? What if you could update it from any location on campus? That forms the core of our idea â€” a whiteboard device where you can draw and write messages from anywhere using your mobile device.

Our presentation slides for our product contain images, technical details, and our pitch to industry judges during the hackathon: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1oXL-UVSUKEl8SZ1EFlXJt8-8BcVPcubrDTF5FJEsTZE/edit?usp=sharing 

We used the Adafruit_SSD1306 library to create graphic images and text on the OLED. To create a websocket server and integrate HTML and CSS, we used an Arduino ESP32 filesystem uploader titled SPIFFs. Both of the READMEs and their documentation can be found below.

This is a library for our Monochrome OLEDs based on SSD1306 drivers

These displays use I2C or SPI to communicate, 2 to 5 pins are required to interface.

Preferred installation method is to use the Arduino IDE Library Manager. To download the source from Github instead, click "Clone or download" above, then "Download ZIP." After uncompressing, rename the resulting folder Adafruit_SSD1306. Check that the Adafruit_SSD1306 folder contains Adafruit_SSD1306.cpp and Adafruit_SSD1306.h.

You will also have to install the **Adafruit GFX library** which provides graphics primitves such as lines, circles, text, etc. This also can be found in the Arduino Library Manager, or you can get the source from https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-GFX-Library

## Changes
Pull Request:
   (September 2019) 
   * new #defines for SSD1306_BLACK, SSD1306_WHITE and SSD1306_INVERSE that match existing #define naming scheme and won't conflict with common color names
   * old #defines for BLACK, WHITE and INVERSE kept for backwards compat (opt-out with #define NO_ADAFRUIT_SSD1306_COLOR_COMPATIBILITY)

Version 1.2 (November 2018) introduces some significant changes:

  * Display dimensions are now specified in the constructor...you no longer need to edit the .h file for different screens (though old sketches can continue to work that way).
  * SPI transactions are used and SPI bitrate can be specified (both require Arduino 1.6 or later).
  * SPI and Wire (I2C) interfaces other than the defaults are supported.

# Arduino ESP32 filesystem uploader (SPIFFS)

Arduino plugin which packs sketch data folder into SPIFFS filesystem image,
and uploads the image to ESP32 flash memory.

## Installation

- Make sure you use one of the supported versions of Arduino IDE and have ESP32 core installed.
- Download the tool archive from [releases page](https://github.com/me-no-dev/arduino-esp32fs-plugin/releases/latest).
- In your Arduino sketchbook directory, create tools directory if it doesn't exist yet.
- Unpack the tool into tools directory (the path will look like ```<home_dir>/Arduino/tools/ESP32FS/tool/esp32fs.jar```).
- Restart Arduino IDE. 

On the OS X create the tools directory in ~/Documents/Arduino/ and unpack the files there

## Usage

- Open a sketch (or create a new one and save it).
- Go to sketch directory (choose Sketch > Show Sketch Folder).
- Create a directory named `data` and any files you want in the file system there.
- Make sure you have selected a board, port, and closed Serial Monitor.
- Select *Tools > ESP32 Sketch Data Upload* menu item. This should start uploading the files into ESP32 flash file system.

  When done, IDE status bar will display SPIFFS Image Uploaded message. Might take a few minutes for large file system sizes.
